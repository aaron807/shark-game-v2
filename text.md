Shark Game
Story:
Sam the shark hasn't eaten in days, he is very hungry and he needs your help to catch some fish for him to eat.
Watch out though, poachers are trying to catch Sam, so you'll have to be extra careful to avoid their nets.
Be sure to eat blue fish as they speed up Sam and make him go extra fast!
